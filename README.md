LED turns on when '1' is pressed. It turns off when '0' is pressed.

# What I plan to build
Gonna use the APDS9960 sensor to turn the LED on/off based on the gesture detected. This is pretty basic and simple but I think the gesture thing is cool.
We see so many gesture activated things in the world (especially after COVID).
Maybe I will get more creative when I have more time to think about it and use it more than to just turn an LED on/off.

# Components required 
So far APDS9960 sensor (already have), LED, resistors
If I get creative maybe some other sensor
